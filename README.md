### Pup is an ios app I made using swift created to help all dog parents with the responsibility of owning a puppy.

When you open the app you are greeted by the homepage that asks you to enter your dog's name.

Pressing enter takes you to the second view where you are asked for permission to revieve notifications from the application.

After getting permission, you can start setting up a feeding and showering schedule that suits you.

When you press the "feeding schedule" you will see a menue with two schedules: Availabe, which has three different feeding times. Busy, with two feeding times 12hrs apart. Demo, for presenting the project.

Shower schedule is similar to the feeding schedule but instead of two different schedules you can pick between any weekday as you should shower your puppy once a week.

Based on the schedules you picked, you will recieve local notifications to remind you to feed/shower your puppy as well as walking your dog an hour after feeding.

When you press the notification it will take you to the app's second view.

The design of the app is pretty simple, the big blue button in the homepage which takes in your dog's name. As well as the pictures in the second view that are related to the feeding/showering schedule and the menu list.
I was hoping to take the app to the next level by creating a social section, where all the dog owners in your area could chat and arrange meet ups with their dogs at local parks.

With Pup, transition into the dog lifestyle responsibly!
